Earth is the third planet in our solar system. It is in the shape which is close to sphere (spheroid). Earth is called the “blue planet” because it looks blue in colour when it is seen from outer space. It looks blue because there is water on this planet.

It is the only planet that has life on it. Life is possible on Earth because of water and because of all the gases which are important for life. Earth is in perfect distance from Sun and so there is a mild climate here. Other planets are too hot or too cold and life is impossible there.

Earth was formed over 4.5 billion years ago. It has one Moon which orbits around it. Moon is Earth’s natural satellite. Earth rotates through its centre on its axis. Poles are the two points where the axis meet the surface of the Earth. These two poles are the North Pole and the South Pole.

Earth completes one rotation in twenty-four hours. This is called a solar day. It rotates from left to right. There are four seasons which occur on the planet. These seasons occur because the axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbit’s plane.

There are four layers which combine together and make this planet. These layers are, the Crust, the Mantle, Outer-Core and the Inner-Core. The crust includes the land, seas, oceans and mountain peaks.

The Earth is surrounded by gases which is called its Atmosphere. However, because of Global warming Earth is in danger. It is called mother Earth because it gives birth to us. We should take care of it.
